<p> When I'm feeling lonely
    Sad as I can be
    All by myself, an uncharted island
    In an endless sea
    What makes me happy
    Fills me up with glee
    Those bones in my jaw!
    Don't have a flaw
    My shiny teeth and me
    My shiny teeth that twinkle
    Just like the stars in space
    My shiny teeth that sparkle
    Adding beauty to my face
    My shiny teeth that glisten
    Just like a Christmas tree
    You know they'd walk a mile
    Just to see me smile (Woo!)
    My shiny teeth and me
    (Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
    Yes, they're all so perfect
    So white and pearly
    Brush, gargle, rinse
    A couple breath mints
    My shiny teeth and me
    My shiny teeth, so awesome
    Just like your favorite song
    My shiny teeth, I floss them
    So they'll grow to be real strong
    My shiny teeth, I love them
    And they all love me
    Why should I talk to you
    When I've got 32 (Woo!)
    Shiny teeth and me
    (Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
    My shiny teeth that twinkle
    Just like the stars in space
    My shiny teeth that sparkle
    Adding beauty to my face
    My shiny teeth that glisten
    Just like a Christmas tree
    You know they'd walk a mile
    Just to see me smile (Woo!)
    My shiny teeth and me
    (Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
    My shiny teeth and me
    (Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
    My shiny teeth and me
    (Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
    My shiny teeth and me
    (Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)</p>
